## Overview  
This repository contains the code and data for our study on the performance of open-source large language models (LLMs) in part-of-speech (POS) tagging for Old Occitan. We analyze the challenges posed by non-standardized orthography and diachronic variation in historical language processing.  

## Abstract  
Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language processing, yet their effectiveness in handling historical languages remains largely unexplored. This study examines the performance of open-source LLMs in POS tagging for Old Occitan, a historical language characterized by non-standardized orthography and significant diachronic variation. By analyzing hagiographical and medical corpora, we highlight the limitations of LLMs in processing low-resource historical languages and provide recommendations for improvement.  

## Repository Contents  
- **Corpus Data**: Preprocessed Old Occitan texts (hagiographical & medical).  
- **POS Tagging Models**: Implementations of LLM-based tagging experiments.  
- **Evaluation Scripts**: Code for performance analysis.
